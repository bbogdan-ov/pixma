# /!\\ Work in progress /!\\

This project is still at a very early stage of development!\
Sooner or later, I will definitely bring this project into shape (i hope)

**Pixma will be free and open source forever**\
The Internet is mired in the shit of proprietary software and "trial periods" and we need to do something with it

# Pixma!

This project is a complete rewrite of my other project [Pixel Share](https://pixel-share.vercel.app/) ([code](https://github.com/bogdan-ov/pixel-share))

I was about 15 y.o. back then (I'm almost 18 now (holy shit, time flies so fast)) so the code is garbage\
For pixel share [next.js](https://nextjs.org/), because I was just stupid and wanted to create a whole community website for pixel artists where they can upload palettes and their arts, but a little later I decided that an editor wouldn't be bad either. **So I crap out PIXEL SHARE!!**

Now I've become a bit smarter and decided to rewrite this project, but just *(for now :))* an editor, using vanilla typescript

I would like to hope that this project will not fall apart and people will use and love it

### Plans

- Frame-by-frame animation
- Generating animations and images using code
- Plugins support
- Desktop app, probably using [tauri](https://tauri.app/)
- Importing palettes from [lospec](https://lospec.com/)

### Really good pixel art editors

While you're waiting (prabably not) check out these cool editors:

- **Aseprite**. One of the main inspirers\
  Super fast and functional editor written in C++\
  You need money to use it!\

- **GIMP**. Another inspirer\
  Fast, lightweight and simple FREE alternative to PAID AND PROPRIETARY photoshop WITH A MONTHLY PAYMENT\
  [Tap](https://www.gimp.org/)
- **Piskel**. RIP\
  Simple and fast web editor (also with desktop app using [nw.js](https://nwjs.io/))\
  Sadly, it is no longer supported by the original developer\
